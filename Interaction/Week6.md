## Lab practices

##### Types of evaluation (Control settings)
Involve Users (Analytic)
Do not involve Users (Empirical)

##### Analytic Approaches
1. Heuristic evalution
2. Cognitive walkthrough

##### Empirical Approaches 
1. Usability Test
2. Experiment

Method: Think Outloud

##### Cognitive Walkthrough
Found by Cathleen Wharton
1. Simulating the process
2. Ease of Learning

###### Example:
Action sequences n * cognitive walkthrough Questions m
n*m questions

##### Observation
For：
Data gathering
Any stage in development
Early/Late/Evaluation

###### Two types:
Direct: Investigater to study users
Indirect: Investigate result of activity after performed

Two places:
Field studies
Lab studies (Controlled environment)

Usability Labs
Portable Labs
Labs studies know what users doing, but dont know what they are doing 
——> Think aloud (say what they think)

Problems: User not expert and they silence
Use questions to prompt users

Tips: 1. Take notes on everything
2. Dont be afraid to let users get mistake or stucked

##### Why, What Where and When for evaluation
WHYS
Usability
User Experience
Design sells
Real Problems

##### Controlled settings
Ethical:
Protecting Participants
Informed consent

##### Experiment
1. Hypothesis Testing
2. Statistical Analysis

##### Variables
Independent (you can manipulate)
Dependent (you measure)

Null hypothesis and Alternative hypothesis

##### Designs
Between subjects (independent group) -> compare groups performence
Within subjects (Same users) -> repeated measures on both system

Reliability 
whether can be repelicated
and Validity 
should be considered

##### Labs
Lab in a box (suitcase) are portable
they pack away neatly into a convenient carrying case.
