## Field studies

##### Difference to Lab study:
Natural settings
Messy
Activities overlap
Interrupted by events and people

##### Other names:
In situ studies (lacking in original place)
In the wild studies (contrast to in the lab)

##### advantages:
For ubiquitous techs
Real world success

##### disadvantages:
Little or no control
Difficult to test hypotheses
Interruption

##### Three types:
Current behavior
Proof of concept
Experience of prototype

##### Current behavior study:
Understand what are people doing 
implication for future technology
(Brush and Inkpen) shared and user of tech in domestic environments

##### Prove of concept
DOes it work in real world?
To validate prototypes
##### Context-Aware power management

##### Experience using a prototype
Wizard of OZ used


##### Difference to Lab study
Hidden variables 
Within subjects will be better design
Qualitative comparison

##### technique gathering data
Logging
Survey
Experience sampling
Diaries
Interviews
Unstructured observation

##### logging
quantitative method
Prototype sends data

##### survey types
Presurvey
Postcondition (examine effects on groups)
Postsurvey (end of study)

type of questions:
Open-ended (qualitatiive)
Multiple choice (quantitative)
Likert scale (1-7 level agreement) (quantitative)

##### good and bad surveys
7tips:
1. consistent interpretation
2. willing to answer
3. respondent will answer truthfully
4. question with known answer
5. Avoid double barrelled question (single answer but two part)
6. Avoid biased terms or wording
7. Pretest your question

##### confirmation bias
 When we want to believe something, we tend to only seek evidence that confirms our desired belief and ignore the rest.  When we do come across disconfirming evidence, we are more likely to dismiss the evidence and not critically evaluate it (Nickerson, 1998).  
 If two people have the same information, the information is generally interpreted in such a way that supports one's existing beliefs (Lord, Ross, & Lepper, 1979). 
  People who seek and interpret information critically and systematically, without bias, can still later recall the information selectively based on existing beliefs (Hamilton, 2005).

##### Diaries
Similar technique to ESM
Initiated by users (info)

##### Interview
using semi-structured
Audio-video recording
Photos
BUT
Little interaction with participants


Quantitative = number
Qualitative = words

##### statistics
Descriptive  describe sample
Inferential  sample represents population

Coding:
Pre-existing themes
Testing theory (deduction)

Non preexisting themes
Deriving themes (induction)
Theory building

##### Brush define experiments
1. Study design
2. Technology
3. Running test
4. Data collection and analysis

##### four tips of study design
1. Clear research goal (question)
2. Study design document
3. Scripts for visits
4. pilot (dressed reheresal)

##### five tips of technology
1. Robust enough technology
2. Other evaluation methods
3. Existing technology
4. Get feedback during study (reassuring feedback)
5. Plan B (negative result)

##### four tips for running the study 
1. Research team (managable)
2. participants are comfortable
3. Take safety of participant and surveyors
4. Flexibility 

##### three tips for data collection and analysis
1. Be objectives
2. Dont argue with participant, dont get defensive (participant always right)
3. Find limitation, dont make inappropriate claims
